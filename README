The first version of NPlot-Gtk was made by Miguel de Icaza, and was 
a wrapper of NPlot 0.9.8.5.

Now the wrapper of version 0.9.9.2 has just an NPlot upgrade and 
a few hacks over the work of Miguel (Carlos)

------------------------

This version of NPlot has been extended to support Gtk# on Linux.

The version is based on NPlot 0.9.9.2

To build, type `make'

The Gtk# demo is in lib/mf.exe and lib/test.exe

Notice that you must include in your distirbution not only the .dll
files, but also the .config files.
